After some consideration and the shutting down of a couple of my other blogs, I think I am just going to continue with my blogs as such. I have reduced the number to three (this one, [Es Wird Kalt](http://www.eswirdkalt.com) and [Und Es Regnet](http://www.undesregnet.com)) and I think that will suffice. That is much better than the seven which I had before.

My decision lies in the fact that most of the readers of History Rhymes read this blog for history and not for anything else. So I’ve decided to keep it separate and write only about history here. Everything else will be on [Und Es Regnet](http://www.undesregnet.com).

Now it’s time to get back to some history.
