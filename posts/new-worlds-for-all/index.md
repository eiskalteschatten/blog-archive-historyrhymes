This semester I am taking a survey class of US history up to 1865. For that class, I just finished reading a book entitled *[New Worlds for All: Indians, Europeans, and the Remaking of Early America](http://astore.amazon.com/historyrhymesalex-20/detail/080185959X)* by Colin G. Calloway.

[![New Worlds for All](4188H4YTBML._SL210_.jpg "New Worlds for All")](http://astore.amazon.com/historyrhymesalex-20/detail/080185959X)

New Worlds for All

The book itself was actually quite interesting. Calloway discusses how the world not only changed for the Europeans who came over to the Americas, but also how life changed for the natives who had already been here for centuries. From my experience, I can say that most Americans tend not to even consider the Native American viewpoint on the European invasion on their lands.
