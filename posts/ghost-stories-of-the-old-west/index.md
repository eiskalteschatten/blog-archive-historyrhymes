Ghost Stories of the Old West edited by Dan Asfar

So I decided to take a break from reading non-fiction and treat myself to a book full of short ghost stories of the old west. The book I found is appropriately titled [*Ghost Stories of the Old West*](http://astore.amazon.com/historyrhymesalex-20/detail/1894877179) and is by Dan Asfar. I really haven’t gotten very far into it at all; only a few pages, but so far I am really enjoying it. If you’re up for some ghost stories with a Western theme, then you might want to give this book a try.
