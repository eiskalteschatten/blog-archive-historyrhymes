Wyoming Territorial Prison

The semester is finally over for me. I had my last final and had to turn in my last paper yesterday. The paper was an interesting paper, however, because it involved the history of the Wyoming Territorial Prison Museum. It wasn’t about this history of the prison itself, but rather of the site as a museum. The research we did was original research. One of the requirements for the paper was to conduct an oral interview with a person who has been involved somehow with the administration of the museum at some point since it became a museum in 1990.

My interviewee was originally supposed to be a lady who has worked there (and still continues to work there) since the early nineties. Unfortunately I was unable to get ahold of her in time, so I ended up interviewing my professor who was involved with evaluating a couple of grants for the Prison Museum, reviewing a script for a movie that was to be made about the prison and is even currently serving on the Master Planning Committee for the Prison Museum.

As the first oral history interview I’ve ever done, I think it actually went rather well. The interview will be archived at the American Heritage Center at the University of Wyoming for future reference.
