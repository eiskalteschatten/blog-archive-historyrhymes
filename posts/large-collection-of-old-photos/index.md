Today I stumbled upon [a website](http://www.old-picture.com/) with quite a large collection of old photos from the 19th century and really early 20th century. The site contains several collections, including a [Civil War](http://www.old-picture.com/civil-war-index-001.htm) collection and an [Old West](http://www.old-picture.com/old-west-index-001.htm) collection.

A couple of my favorites come from the Civil War collection and are posted below:

[![President Lincoln at Antietam](President-Lincoln-Antietam.jpg "President Lincoln at Antietam")](http://www.old-picture.com/civil-war/President-Antietam-Lincoln-Abraham.htm)

President Lincoln at Antietam

I really like this photo of President Lincoln at Antietam because shows Lincoln in a semi-private moment which is a rarity among the photographs taken of President Lincoln during his presidency.

[![Gallows](Gallows.jpg "Gallows")](http://www.old-picture.com/civil-war/Gallows.htm)

Gallows

I suppose I like this one for more morbid reasons. Perhaps because it shows a darker side of the war.

In any case, I would take a look through the collection of old photos, located here: [http://www.old-picture.com](http://www.old-picture.com/). There is also [a blog](http://old-photos.blogspot.com/) that goes along with it that I would also take a look at.
