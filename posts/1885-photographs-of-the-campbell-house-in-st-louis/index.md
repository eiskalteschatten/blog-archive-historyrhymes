I have to admit that I have an unhealthy obsession with 19th century architecture and houses in general which means that whenever I come across photos taken in the 19th century of a house from that period, I get quite excited. I’m not entirely sure how I managed to stumble upon this website, but I ended up on [the website for the Campbell House](http://stlouis.missouri.org/501c/chm/index.html) in St. Louis, Missouri.

I’ve posted 4 of the photographs taken in 1885 from the website here. You can find the rest of the collection of 60 photographs on [the Campbell House website](http://stlouis.missouri.org/501c/chm/photos.htm).
