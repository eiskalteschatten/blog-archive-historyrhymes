I have posted a new featured book called *[Native American Testimony](http://astore.amazon.com/historyrhymesalex-20/detail/0140281592)* edited by Peter Nabokov. This book is a very interesting culmination of testimonials by Native Americans about the coming of the white man. What makes this such a unique volume is that it is told from the perspective of the Native Americans rather than from the Anglo-American perspective with which we are all so familiar.

Peter Nabokov has provided us with a collection of testimonials that range from prophesies about the coming of the white man into Native American territory through the end of the twentieth century. As I continue reading through the book, I will probably discuss portions of it that I find interesting here.

This is one of three books which I will be reading for a Native American Studies course I am taking this semester. The other two are *[The Earth Shall Weep: A History of Native America](http://astore.amazon.com/historyrhymesalex-20/detail/080213680X)* by James Wilson and *[North American Indians: A Comprehensive Account](http://astore.amazon.com/historyrhymesalex-20/detail/0131928767)* by Alice B. Kehoe.
