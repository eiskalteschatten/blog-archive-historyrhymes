Last night I finished [*Ghost Stories of the Old West* by Dan Asfar](http://astore.amazon.com/historyrhymesalex-20/detail/1894877179). Other than several editing mistakes (spelling, grammar, etc), the book was actually quite good. You always hear about legends and myths from Europe about haunted castles and so on, but to read the legends of some of America’s own haunted places is really quite fascinating.

My Life on the Plains by George A. Custer

Now that I’ve treated myself to some good ol’ ghost stories, it’s time to get back to business. This time I’ve chosen to read [*My Life on the Plains: Personal Experiences with Indians* by George Armstrong Custer](http://astore.amazon.com/historyrhymesalex-20/detail/080611357X) of Little Bighorn fame. As of now, I’ve read the introduction which give a little bit of background information about Custer and about his memoirs.
