While browsing around the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian, I ran across a series of [interesting online exhibits](http://www.nmai.si.edu/subpage.cfm?subpage=exhibitions&second=online). Iâ€™ve only had time to check out one of them, but I would highly recommend looking through them. They provide a very interesting look into Native American culture, art, etc.

Listening to Our Ancestors

The exhibit I visited was called [Listening to Our Ancestors](http://www.nmai.si.edu/listening) and featured several different tribes from the Canadian Pacific coast. The idea behind this exhibit was to reunite members of a handful of tribes from the Canadian Pacific coast with traditional objects that once had special significance to their respective tribes. Their stories about the objects are posted in the exhibit as well as several very interesting pictures.
