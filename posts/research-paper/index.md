I know it’s been a long time since I have posted here and I apologize for that. I have been ridiculously busy with homework for classes and work. As of now I am working on a research paper for one of my history classes. I am writing about the decline of the British monarchy in the 19th century. So far it’s quite an interesting subject. I may be writing a few posts about British history as that is what I am taking this semester and will be taking more next semester.

Wyoming Territorial Prison in the 19th century

Starting next semester, I will be beginning an internship at the [Wyoming Territorial Prison Museum](http://www.wyomingtalesandtrails.com/laramietpris.html) in Laramie, Wyoming. My responsibilities will include research, setting up and maintaining exhibits, giving tours in both English and German and translating brochures and other literature into German. I will also be working at the front desk part-time and updating and maintaining the museum’s website. I am certainly looking forward to it.

I will try to be more frugal about posting here as things start settling down.
