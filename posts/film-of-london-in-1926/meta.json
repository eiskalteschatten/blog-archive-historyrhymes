  "excerpt": "I spent a good hour or so going through old videos of England taken in the 1920s. Of all of them, my favorite was a film made of London in 1926 &#8212; the same year Queen Elizabeth II was born &#8212; which I&#8217;ve embedded within the article. I absolutely love watching the people back then just imagining what it would have been like to live in such a different era to our own.\n",
