  "excerpt": "I recently subscribed to a couple of history magazines that I really enjoy a lot. The first one is called Wild West and, as the title implies, discusses events that happened in the &#8220;wild west&#8221; days of the US. This seems to me to be a fairly unique magazine as I have not really found &#8230; more &#x2192;\n",
