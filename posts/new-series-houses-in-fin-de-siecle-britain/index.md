Rendition of a Victorian Fireplace

Quite some time ago, I did a research project about houses in Fin-de-Siècle Britain. This resulted in a long essay about middle-class houses during this time period which specifically focused on general tendencies in architecture, architectural features, façades, floor plans, as well as interior design. Since I have just recently dug out this research and dusted it off, I thought it fitting to share it here since it will otherwise never again see the light of day.

I haven’t written very much about houses and architecture on History Rhymes despite it being one of my many interests in history. It is a difficult topic to write about as it not easy to compose an interesting narrative to capture the reader’s interest and hold it. As such, this series will primarily be more academically oriented and focused more on presenting the results of the research rather than recreating a story about the past.

This post is part of a multi-part series about the houses in Fin-de-Siècle Britain. See the rest of the series either on the [Houses in Fin-de-Siècle Britain project page](https://www.historyrhymes.info/featured/houses-in-fin-de-siecle-britain/) or in [the category of the same name](https://www.historyrhymes.info/category/multi-part-series/houses-in-fin-de-siecle-britain/).
