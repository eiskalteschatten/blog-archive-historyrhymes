I am pleased to announce that History Rhymes now has a brand new design. It is a completely custom design I have been working on for quite some time now and I really hope you enjoy it!

The new site was designed to be easy to read and yet mimic the way books looked that were published in the nineteenth century. One of my favorite features is the old photos at the bottom of the page. If you click on the little picture frame icon at the top-left corner, it will take you automatically to them. I have developed a relatively extensive collection of digitized photos from the nineteenth century and have decided to share them here. Every time you load a page now on History Rhymes, a new photo will be randomly selected and displayed at the bottom of the page.

One last thing I should mention though is that Internet Explorer 8 and below are no longer supported on this site. This is because the new design uses the latest web technologies which are simply not available in older version of Internet Explorer. If you are using an older version, there will be a notification at the top of the page with instructions on what you can do to upgrade to a new browser.

Let me know what you guys think about the new design! Any feedback will be most welcome! I will also be added bits and pieces to it here and there as time goes on and I think of new, small tweaks I can add to make the design look even better.
