  "excerpt": "King Otto I was the king who never reigned. His story was a tragic one that to this day remains unique in the history of Bavaria. He became king upon his older brother&#8217;s death, but as he had already been declared insane and mentally unfit to rule, his uncle took over his royal duties as prince regent.\n",
