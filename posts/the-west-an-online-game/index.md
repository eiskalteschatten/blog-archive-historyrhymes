A little while ago I ran across an interesting text and image based online role playing game with an old American ‘wild west’ theme. I debated about whether or not to write about it here on History Rhymes as the game is unfortunately in German, but in the end, I decided to go ahead and write a blurb about it.

'The West' Online RPG

Although I haven’t really played it much due to a complete lack of time, it looks like quite a fun game. The idea is that you are new to the wild west and from there, you can be a wandering cowboy, a farmer, a shop keeper, bar tender, etc. You can found your own towns, engage in gun fights with other players, etc. I am not the type that usually enjoys role playing games, but I suppose you might say this game has a theme that hits home with one of my biggest interests. I am going to delve into it more as I go along.

I really wish I could find a game like it in English, but unfortunately have been unable to find anything even remotely similar. If I do run across something however, I will also post about it here.

You can find the game at [http://www.the-west.de](http://www.the-west.de).
