*Europe in the High Middle Ages* by William Chester Jordan

This week I have a new featured book called [*Europe in the High Middle Ages*](http://astore.amazon.com/historyrhymesalex-20/detail/0140166645) by William Chester Jordan. It is a very well-written book which details the Europe in the eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. It covers a range of topics from the Mediterranean to Scandinavia, the Crusades to monasteries, the Catholic Church to the Holy Roman Emperor, and so on.

The book is written in a manner which is easy for the casual reader to understand and follow, but academic and detailed enough to be of value to the medieval field.
