Shakespeare in 1610

I just got through reading [an interesting article from the BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7931823.stm) about archaeologists having found and partially excavated the foundation of the original theater Shakespeare would have used. It is believed that the premier of plays such as Romeo and Juliet and an older version of Hamlet were performed at this theater with Shakespeare himself possibly acting.

The article also talks about a newly discovered portrait of Shakespeare, believed to have been painted in 1610. As mentioned in the clip below, it is ” thought to be the only surviving image of him made during his lifetime.” It is pictured above.

> Taryn Nixon, from the Museum of London, said her team had found part of the original curved wall of the playhouse, which was believed to be polygonal in shape.
