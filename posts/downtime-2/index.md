I am sorry to report that History Rhymes experienced some downtime yesterday and this morning. There was a major problem with the server which hosts History Rhymes which led to the website not being reachable. Everything seems to now be up and running again and I hope that this problem with not occur again in the future.

Thank you for your patience!
