  "excerpt": "As most of my readers probably know, I am a huge fan of Mark Twain. The name of this blog comes from a quote he made about history and a lot of my inspiration comes from his works. The recent news of a Montgomery, Alabama-based publisher publishing a censored version of one of Twain&#8217;s most famous books, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is really rather sickening to me.\n",
