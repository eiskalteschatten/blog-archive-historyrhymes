CNN is running [an interesting article](http://www.cnn.com/2009/LIVING/06/12/mf.civil.war/index.html) with seven little-known trivia facts about the Civil War. I will list the seven facts below, but for more details about them, take a look at CNN’s [article](http://www.cnn.com/2009/LIVING/06/12/mf.civil.war/index.html).

> 2.  Hungry ladies effectively mugged Jefferson Davis
> 3.  The Union used hot air balloons and submarines
> 4.  “Dixie” was only a northern song
> 5.  Paul Revere was at Gettysburg
> 6.  Mark Twain fired one shot and then left
> 7.  The armies weren’t all-male
