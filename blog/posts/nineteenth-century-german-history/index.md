Despite having [just begun another series](https://www.historyrhymes.info/featured/rocky-mountain-mining-towns/), I am going to be embarking on a second multi-part series which has to do with nineteenth century German history. The goal of the project will be to give a survey of nineteenth century German history.

You may ask why I am going to be pursuing such a project on a blog about American history, but the answer is two-fold. First of all, I enjoy German history quite a bit and so I find this project to be different and extremely interesting all at the same time. Secondly, I will be undertaking this project for a history class which I am currently taking.

That being said, I hope you enjoy this project and can learn something about German history. You will be able to find all of the entries either on the [Nineteenth Century German History project page](https://www.historyrhymes.info/featured/nineteenth-century-german-history/) or in [the category of the same name](https://www.historyrhymes.info/category/multi-part-series/nineteenth-century-german-history/).
