The other day I stumbled upon a website called [Academic Earth](http://academicearth.org). The purpose of the website is to provide free lectures on various subjects from the leading universities in the US. I very eagerly browsed through their [history section](http://academicearth.org/subjects/history) and ran across [a series of lectures by Professor David W. Blight from Yale University](http://academicearth.org/courses/the-civil-war-and-reconstruction-era-1845-1877) about the American Civil War and the period of Reconstruction afterwards. The videos on the site include the entire course. I intend to watch every one of the lectures which are quite detailed and are about 45 minutes long each.
