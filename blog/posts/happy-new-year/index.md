I know it’s 14 days late, but better late than never!

Actually, I spent most of the holidays with my family and a friend of mine, both of whom live in a different state. I have not had time nor ability to make any updates to any of my blogs unfortunately. The good news is that I am back at my university and should have plenty of time now.

This semester I am taking a Native American studies class, so I might just be posting more about the Native Americans. We’ll see how it goes though.
