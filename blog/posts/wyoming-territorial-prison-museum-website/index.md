For the past couple of weeks in between final projects for the university, I’ve been working on the website for the Wyoming Territorial Prison Museum. Originally I was going to do an internship there, but because that fell through due to timing issues, I was just commissioned instead to do [the website](http://www.wyomingterritorialpark.com).

Wyoming Territorial Prison in the late 1890s

My goal was to somewhat mimic the design of this blog, but of course with its own look and feel. I think I’ve successfully accomplished that. Now that the site is up and full operational, I am going to be translating the site into German by request of the museum curator. I’ve already started the process, but I haven’t finished that part yet.

The English version is complete, however, and I recommend you take a look at it here: [http://www.wyomingterritorialpark.com](http://www.wyomingterritorialpark.com).
