As part of my efforts to reinvent History Rhymes, I would like to not only publish articles about various topics in nineteenth-century American and European history, but also write about the latest news and research in the field. Of course as a single person, this is a difficult task to keep up with.

That is why I am asking for your help. If you have any news tips or would like to point to a source of nineteenth-century news, please [contact me](https://www.historyrhymes.info/about/contact/) about it.

If it is a piece of news, then please also include the source so that I can reference it and follow up.

Thank you!
