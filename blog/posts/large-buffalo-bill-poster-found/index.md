I read an interesting article on 9news.com yesterday that I thought I would share here. For those of you who don’t know what 9news is, it’s one of Denver’s news channels (NBC).

[The article](http://www.9news.com/news/article.aspx?storyid=119679&catid=188) is about a new poster that was found dating back to 1887 promoting Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show. The poster was used an as advertisement for the show in London when they toured in England.

Here is a portion of the article:
