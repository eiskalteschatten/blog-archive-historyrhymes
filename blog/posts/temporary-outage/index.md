I apologize for the temporary outage. I’ve been getting hit pretty hard with spambots and my hosting service shut down service to my account. I think I’ve got it taken care of after doing some careful research about redirecting traffic coming from spambots so that they don’t hit the server anywhere near as hard. If you have any difficulties with the site, please let me know as soon as possible by sending me [an email](https://www.historyrhymes.info/about/contact/).

**Update:** The site was down again for a while because apparently the actions I took against the spambots weren’t quite enough. I researched again some more and am trying something else now. Again, don’t hesitate to contact me if you have issues. Also, if you have suggestions for fighting off spambots, please let me know by either sending me an e-mail or leaving a comment here!

Thank you for your patience!
