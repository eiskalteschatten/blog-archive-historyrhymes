I apologize for the delay in posting. I just haven’t had as much time as I would really like to. The next part of the [Who were the real cowboys?](http://historyrhymes.alexseifert.com/?cat=127) series is well underway, I have just not had the time needed to finish it quite yet.

Currently, I am working on an essay for a literature course I am taking and I promise I will be more diligent in posting after I am finished with it.
