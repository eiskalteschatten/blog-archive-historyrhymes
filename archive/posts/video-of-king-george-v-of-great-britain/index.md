In continuing with interesting old videos of European monarchs of the late nineteenth/early twentieth century, I have posted a video of the Duke of York (later King George V of Great Britain). This is a longer video than the last, but nevertheless interesting. The video is from 1901. I find it quite fascinated to watch these old videos knowing that they were filmed over a century ago.
