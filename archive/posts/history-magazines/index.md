I recently subscribed to a couple of history magazines that I really enjoy a lot. The first one is called [Wild West](http://astore.amazon.com/historyrhymesalex-20/detail/B00005N7VL) and, as the title implies, discusses events that happened in the “wild west” days of the US. This seems to me to be a fairly unique magazine as I have not really found any others about the same topic anywhere else.

The other magazine I highly recommend is the [BBC History Magazine](http://astore.amazon.com/historyrhymesalex-20/detail/B00006LB2B). This one has more generic history than a specifically focused topic. They do, however, tend to have somewhat of a focus on British history, although that is not all that they cover.
