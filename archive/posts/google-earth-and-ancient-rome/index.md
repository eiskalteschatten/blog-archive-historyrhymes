I know this has absolutely nothing to do with American history whatsoever, but I found it quite fascinating, so I thought I would share it here. Google Earth has announced a new layer in which you can tour a completely 3-dimensional version of Ancient Rome as it was in AD 320. The models for the buildings and everything were done in conjunction with [Rome Reborn Project](http://www.romereborn.virginia.edu) sponsored by the University of Virginia to create the most historically accurate simulation possible.

Watch the YouTube video compiled by Google for a preview and more of an explanation:
