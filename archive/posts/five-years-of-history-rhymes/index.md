“The South Pass” from Roughing It by Mark Twain

It is really hard to believe that History Rhymes has been around now for five years. I have scheduled this entry to be posted exactly five years to the minute after my [my first introduction post](https://www.historyrhymes.info/2008/04/14/starting-out/). So much has happened in the time since I wrote that post that it makes it seems as though it was ages ago. The way has been long since my first post on April 14, 2008 on a [WordPress.com hosted blog](http://historyrhymes.wordpress.com), but well worth it. Since then I have finished college, found a job and have settled down into a comfortable life. Although my job is not history-related as I had originally hoped for, I do still enjoy it and am able to use History Rhymes as a means to pursue this passion of mine.

Originally, I planned on writing a short, informative post every day. I managed to do just that for the first month or so, but then I realized just how strenuous that goal really was and that unfortunately I didn’t have enough time to do that. It was an ambitious goal, but once I gave it up, I settled down to a pattern of writing longer articles once or twice a month depending on my schedule. There is, however, unfortunately a large gap in posts between January 2012 and October 2012 which was really the first long period when I just couldn’t find time to devote to the blog. At the time, I was in my last semester while doing a MA in history and simply just did not have the time.

Now that I have a more settled life though, I have been writing more articles History Rhymes and I hope to continue to do so well into the future. Even if I’m not pursuing a history-related career yet, it is through this blog I mean to make use of my passion for history.

I would like to thank all of my readers for the past five years and I am looking forward to another five and beyond!
