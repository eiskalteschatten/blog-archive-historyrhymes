This really has nothing to do with history, but I thought I would be a staunch self-promoter here as well as my other blogs:

As part of my on going adventures with the German language, I provide translation services from both German to English and English to German. If you are looking for someone who can translate any length of document for relatively cheap, then look no further!

English is my native language and I have 9 years of experience with the German language. I have lived, worked and studied in Germany. For typewritten or digital documents, websites or anything else digital, I charge US $0.08 or 0.06 euros a word. For handwritten documents, I will need to see the document before I can provide a price as handwritten documents can be far more difficult to decipher.
